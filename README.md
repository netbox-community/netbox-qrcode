For advice on configuration please see the two links below:

- [General Configuration >>](docs/README_Subpages/README_Configuration.md)
- [Configuration Examples  >>](docs/README_Subpages/README_Configuration_ExampleLabelConf.md)

### Printing

#### Setting the label printer 

If the print does not look like the preview in the Netbox, first try to get a perfect print using Word. As many printer settings also have an influence on the print result. Borderless printing is possible if the printer (e.g. thermal transfer printer) supports this.

Here is an example of what needs to be considered to print borderless from a Word document. [Go to: Example Zebra ZM400 300dpi label printer and a label 56x32mm. >>](/docs/img/Configuration_Printer_ZM400.png)


#### Setting Browser Print Settings

When you press the “Print” button, there are some print properties that are added by the browser. However, these interfere with the print result. They should therefore be deactivated.

##### Firefox:

| Paper size                                     | User defined                 |
| Margins                                        | none                         |
| Scale                                          | Fit to page width or 100%    |

| Options --> Print backgrounds                  | disable                      |
