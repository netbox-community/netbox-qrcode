    # The following commands are executed
    # - Install Current Version of DebugPy for Debug in Visual Studio Code https://github.com/microsoft/debugpy
    # - PYDEVD_DISABLE_FILE_VALIDATION=1 --> You’re telling the debugger to skip this validation and proceed with debugging
    # - Migrate Netbox
    # - Start Netbox with Modul DebugPy (Xfrozen_modules=off --> Disable Frozen Moduls in DebugPy Mode; 5678 is Debug Port)

    # Enables the synchronization of source code files with the Docker container during debugging.
    # Without this option, changed files in the Docker container are only transferred to VSCode.
    # Currently HTML files are changed live. After saving a *.py file, the container is automatically rebuilt. I don't know if this can be optimized. Greetings LHBL2003.
